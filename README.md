DESCRIPTION
===========

This is (as you may have guessed) a [Processing](http://processing.org) library to make it easier to use the Leap Motion Java libraries in your sketches.

Distribution of the actual Leap Motion library files is currently not allowed by Leap Motion so you have to provide those yourself.

You should use the most current Leap Motion libraries available.  If this P5 library does not work with the latest Leap libs then this library is broken.
